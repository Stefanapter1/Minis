<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<ol>
	<li> First, let’s start off with the motor. EV’s like the Tesla Model S or any Tesla or EV in general, 
		 use a motor called the Induction Motor created by Nikola Tesla. This motor uses a 3-phased AC Power 
		 Input to turn the rotators in the motor. The rotators produce a rotating magnetic field allowing the 
		 gears to turn and create torque for the wheels to move.
	</li>
	<li> Next is power. An electric motor is powered by a battery pack consisting of hundreds of different 
		 small-celled lithium ion batteries which produces DC Power. The Induction Motor needs AC Power which 
		 is why a controller/inverter is used to transfer power and manages speed as it increases or decreases 
		 the amount of voltages depending on what speed you want.
	</li>
	<li> The Induction Motor also acts as a generator for producing power since it uses regenerative breaking 
		 to slow down the car and recharge the battery once you let go of the gas. This helps reduce the use of brakes
		 as it slows the user down and recharge the battery as you let go. Finally, that is it!
	</li>
